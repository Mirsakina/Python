"""
1. Generate 10 fake users with names and ages. 
Ask the user to enter a minimum age, and print only the users who are older.

2. Generate a list of 8 fake email addresses. 
Ask the user to input a domain (e.g. gmail.com) and show which emails match.

3. Generate 20 fake job titles and store them in a set to ensure uniqueness. 
Then display all unique job titles.

4. Generate a tuple of 5 fake countries. Show them to the user, then ask the 
user to guess one. Check if itâ€™s in the list.

5. Generate a dictionary of 5 people with their names as keys and phone numbers as values. 
Let the user search for a name and display the phone number if it exists.
